# AMF.net

An implementation of both AMF0 and AMF3 binary format that is used to serialize ActionScript object graphs written in C#.

# Why?

So, Flash is dead and Adobe will end support of Flash Player on December 31, 2020. 
I actually never used Flash and had no knowledge of it's build in communication protocol.
It turns out that I had to automate a creepy old software written in Flash.
Since I did not found any good library, I've written my own.

# Audience?

Probably nobody. But hey, It is fun to learn and implement a protocol. I kind liked this one (but no, I will never use it again).
